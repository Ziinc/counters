# Introduction

**Counters** is a web application for logging behavioural events, to encourage habit consistency and enforce behavioural change on the individual level.

Common use cases include personal habit tracking, however, it can also be used for professional contexts, such as observing the behaviour of a team or organization. [Targets](basics/counters#setting-targets) can be set and customized for each behaviour, helping users to identify and carry out behaviours that are falling below a desired execution frequency.

## Getting Started

1. Create a free account at [counters.tznc.net](https://counters.tznc.net/app).
2. Create a new counter.
3. Press the **+** button to increase the counter's tally.
