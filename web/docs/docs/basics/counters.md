# Creating a Counter

You can create a counter by clicking on the "New counter" button.

Counters can be organized and sorted within the list. Drag and drop a counter to re-arrange it.

Counters can be edited by clicking on the counter.

## Setting a Target

Targets can be set as minimum achievement and maintenance level, differentiate between counters that are meeting or above expectations and which need to be worked on.

The app will display the counters in different colors to represent this:

- Below expectations (<100%): Yellow
- Meeting expectations (100%-500%): Green
- Exceeding expectations (>500%): Blue
